# Task 1: Designing a Logo for the Project

## Objective: 
The brand of a project is paramount to deliver the message about its value and goals. A proper brand helps the project get the necessary support and make an impact on all the stages of the project life cycle. A logo can quickly grab viewers’ attention and communicate the project’s core objectives and importance in an interesting way. Logos are a point of identification; they’re the symbol that external people use to recognize the project's unique brand and value. Because a good logo is a visual, aesthetically pleasing element, it triggers positive recall about the project that the name alone might not. A good logo can pique the interest of the public and invite them to learn more about the project.
