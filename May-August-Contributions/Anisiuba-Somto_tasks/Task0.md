**TASK0: GET STARTED WITH OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTION**
Hello Mentors and my fellow applicants, my name is Somto Anisiuba and I am new to the Open source Field. I am very happy I am starting out this journey with OUTREACHY 
I am from Lagos, Nigeria.
I am so excited to be a contributor in this project, as i will learn a lot and also contribute my ideas to the success of the project

**COMPLETED ACTIVITIES:**
- My GitHub account: https://github.com/somtee-tech
- I went through the documentation on how to use, write and contribute to GitHub
- I chose to make my contribution on Task1 which is to create a Data Collection Tool for Tyhoid confirmation and to record its severity.

Thank you Mentor @Stephane Fadanka
