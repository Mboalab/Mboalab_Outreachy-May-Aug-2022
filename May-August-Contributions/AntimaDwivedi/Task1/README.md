# Task 1: Design a Data collection tool to record symptoms Data 

## My Proposed Idea:  [Link for data collection tool](https://antimadwivedi.github.io/Outreachy-2022-task1/)
<b>•</b>I have made an online platform to record the basic information and symptoms associated with a patient.The basic information include <b>name</b>,<b>age</b>,<b>Mobile number</b> and <b>gender</b>.
<b>•</b>All the symptoms taken into consideration are based on a reasearch named  [A Machine Learning Approach to Clinical Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190320358.pdf) published in International Journal of Computer and Information Technology (ISSN: 2279 – 0764) Volume 02– Issue 04, July 2013.<br>User Interface of online platform is developed using html and css and below i am attaching some snapshots:<br><br><br>

<b>•</b>To make the scope global ,this tool is available in  more than 100 languages,so that people all over the globe can use it.<br><br><br>

 <b>•</b>There are total  eighteen symptoms which I have noted down for collection tool(references are taken from the previously mentioned  research paper)  and each symptom has three values(Low, High and Default), in which a patient must select one according to the patient’s feelings. Default exists for symptom not perceived by the patients. <br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
<b>•</b>After the selection of all the symptoms, submission is made to the designed system by clicking submit button and this click saves all the marked symptoms and basic information as well in the [google-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6P23lb1OwRwx5rYFlNkh6rH2uex4N0nsBEQhYdjctI/edit?usp=sharing).<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
<b>•</b><b>Know your Result tab</b> also present in the web page which is responsible to show  the degree of severity  along the classes- Very Low, Low, Moderate, High and Very High.(This is just for visualization ,no algorithm is deployed in the tool)<br><br><br>

<b>•</b>Kindly review the data collection tool and give your feedback.https://antimadwivedi.github.io/Outreachy-2022-task1/
