# DESIGN A MOBILE APPLICATION FOR TYPHOID SCREENING

<p> Tyscreener is a mobile app that assists in the diagnostic of typhoid fever with integrating features for wide and easy adoption and use. </p>

## **Introduction**
<p> The idea is to utilize the high-resolution camera and diagnosed symptoms to diagnose typhoid fever and determine the severity of the disease for each patient. <br>
Tyscreener combines image acquisition, culture image analysis, and result visualization in its slide screening process. <br>
It is also equipped with a database to give both app-users and researchers easy access to the acquired data. <br>
Tycreener makes the screening process faster, more consistent, and less dependent on human expertise. </p>

<p> The  link to the figma design of Tyscreener is found [_here_](https://www.figma.com/file/H7zuS9sL0zBYjsi5VBBIJD/Tyscreener-mobile--App?node-id=0%3A1). </p>

<p> P.S: As ideas unfold, the design of the app will also be taking adjustments, hence it is still being worked on... </p>

## **Disclaimer**: 
<p> This app does not replace medical practitioners to diagnose typhoid fever, but rather it assists them and make the process faster. </p>

## **Key Features**
* Recording symptoms and their duration (how long  the patient has had them); to check severity physically
* capturing images or uploading existing images of the culture for testing by the trained AI such as stool, blood, bone marrow etc (so, permission for app to access camera and media is required).
* Accecssing a database of new/old patients' data
* a documentation on typhoid fever, its causes and prevention
* customized setting according to user experience etc

## **Steps to develop the app**
* First off, the idea was designed using figma design app, with the link to the file provided above
* Then, the figma design will be imported into visual studio code, as a flutter application.
* before doing this, the flutter development environment must have been completely set-up including paths, dependencies, virtual devices etc.
* After coding each screen, the app is deployed on apetize.io for testing and ready to build.


## **How to build**
<p> This application will be open-source, and as such to build the app, one will need to fork, clone the repository to access the application files. </p>
<p> The application will be built with google flutter technology, and as such software such as Andriod studio/visual studio code, git, firebase, flutter sdk, apetize.io are needed. </p>

## **Requirements**
<p> After cloning the repository, run flutter pub get to downloand all the dependencies. <br>
This application will be launced on apetize.io for testing. </p>

## **Still to do**
<p> I am Still to design the settings, typhoid documentary, and contact us pages as per the project's requirement </p>

## others
<p> Green and white was chosen as the app's color scheme given Mboalab is a medical facility </p>
