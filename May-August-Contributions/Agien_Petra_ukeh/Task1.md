# **DATA COLLECTION TOOL**

<p> This task required participants to design a data collection tool to record symptoms and level of severity of tyhpoid fever disease as its objective. </P>
<p> The data is to come from health practitioners who will fill the form for their patients and submit for further analysis. </p>
<p> For this task, i employed a google form due to its convinient and feasible nature, which requires data and email address to fill. </p>
<p> The form's default language is English, and this can be changed to other languages before filling the form. </p>
<p> The form takes into considerationt the acquisition of retrospective (looking at past dataset) and prospective (future dataset) datasets </p>
<p> To fill this form, a password is required for authenticity. </p>

<p> The password here being **Mboalab**. </p>
<p> My contribution or typhoid screening form is in the form of a questionnaire addressed to local practitioners found [here](https://forms.gle/GxbdDuxBydU8U6WTA) </p>

<p> **Thank you....** </p>
