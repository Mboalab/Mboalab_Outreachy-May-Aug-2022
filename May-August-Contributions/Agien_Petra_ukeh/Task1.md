**DATA COLLECTION TOOL**

This task required participants to design a data collection tool to record symptoms and level of severity of tyhpoid fever disease as its objective.
The data is to come from health practitioners who will fill the form for their patients and submit for further analysis.
For this task, i employed a google form due to its convinient and feasible nature, which requires data and email address to fill.
The form's default language is English, and this can be changed to other languages before filling the form.
The form takes into considerationt the acquisition of retrospective (looking at past dataset) and prospective (future dataset) datasets
To fill this form, a password is required for authenticity. 

The password here being **Mboalab**.
My contribution or typhoid screening form is in the form of a questionnaire addressed to local practitioners found [here](https://forms.gle/GxbdDuxBydU8U6WTA)
