# Getting started with open source

<p> Hi everyone, </p>
My name is **Agien Petra Ukeh** , and I just graduated with a B.TECH in computer Software Engineering this December.
<p> Being a techie, and passionate about medicines, given my background, Mboalab got me interested in this internship round </p>.
<p> I am happy to be able to contribute to this project on having a tool to collect typhoid fever clinical data symptom variables that will allow confirm the diagnosis of typhoid and level of severity of the disease, taking into account, local and context specificities e.g, language. </p>
<p> 
 Being a girl in tech, growing up with a nurse, and assisting to sell at my mother's pharmacy, landing at an organization such as Mboalab is an amazing experience.</p> 
<p> 
 This project; improving diagnostics of typhoid through Open Science using an Artificial Intelligence-base technique caught my attention given the widal test has a low PPV, and having a faster, more reliable diagnostic tool will be great.
</p>
<p> 
 Thank you [mentors](https://github.com/PetraAG/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022/tree/main/Meet%20the%20Mentors) for the material on starting with open source, it was really helpful as open source can really be confusing sometimes with a thousand and one ways to do one thing.
</p> 
<p> 
Concepts such as <br> 

- forking, 
- cloning, 
- commiting changes, 
- making pull requests etc are some of the things acquired from the materials provided. 

</p>

<p> 
  I learnt syntax such as using # for headings, * for bulleting, p for paragraphing, br for line breaks etc 
</p>

<p> To contribute, i forked the Mboalab repo to my main repository. <br> Collaborating with github directly, i navigated to the May-august folder, created my folder name by taking new file, write my name followed by a forward slash (/) and this automatically created my folder. </p>
<p> I then took new file inside my folder and named it task0.md, input the data into the file, and took commit changes. I lateron navigated to the contribute icon, and took create new pull request, inserted a description of my request and a title, and took create. Once the request gets merged, i get notified by email. </p>

<p> It is indeed a great experience. </p>
<p> Thank you, and I am Looking forward to a great experience with this community. </P>
