Hi everyone, My name is Agien Petra Ukeh,and 
I am happy to be able to contribute to this project on having a tool to collect typhoid fever clinical data symptom variables that will allow confirm the diagnosis of typhoid and level of severity of the disease, taking into account, local and context specificities e.g, language.
Being a girl in tech, growing up with a nurse, and assisting to sell at my mother's pharmacy, landing at an organization such as Mboalab is an amazing experience. 
This project; improving diagnostics of typhoid through Open Science using an Artificial Intelligence-base technique caught my attention given the widal test has a low PPV, and having a faster, more reliable diagnostic tool will be great.
Thank you [mentors](https://github.com/PetraAG/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022/tree/main/Meet%20the%20Mentors) for the material on starting with open source, it was really helpful as open source can really be confusing sometimes with a thousand and one ways to do one thing. 
Concepts such as forking, cloning, commiting changes, making pull requests etc are some of the things acquired from the materials provided. 
Thank you, and I am Looking forward to a great experience with this community.
