## **Task 0**

### **Introduction**

Hello,

I'm [**Ginika Jemeni**](https://github.com/GinikaJ), a Physiotherapist experienced in managing communicable diseases currently transitioning into Data Analytics.
I chose the ***Mboalab Project*** to contribute to because it's one that resonates with me personally and professionally as an african who has had typhoid; seen other family members and friends have typhoid; and treated patients with typhoid among other conditions.

This is actually my first time using GitHub and contributing to an Open Source project and I'm excited to learn and go through this journey with my fellow contributers and mentors.



### **Tasks Completed**

I completed the following activities.

- [x] I used the following resources to learn how to use GitHub and contribute to Open Source
  - ['Writing on Github'](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
  - [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) - I took all the courses under the Introduction to GitHub module.

- [x] I learnt how to use git to fork, clone, create and delete branches, commit, add, push and pull remotely.

- [x] I carried out what I learnt by successfully forking, cloning the Mboalab Outreachy May-August 2022 Repository ([my Outreachy-2022 branch](https://github.com/GinikaJ/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022/tree/main)), made my branch, made commits and executed a pull request which was merged and contributing to the project.




#### **Conclusion**

I look forward to making more contributions to this project and learning more about Open Source.


Thanks to the contributors and the mentors for all the help and guidnace so far.
