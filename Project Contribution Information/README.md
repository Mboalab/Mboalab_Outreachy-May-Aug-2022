# How to contribute to the project?

As part of the application process, all applicants must make at least one contribution to be accepted as an intern for this project.

 **_Only applicants who contribute will be eligible to be accepted as interns._**
 
 
We are looking for motivated interns who can work in an inclusive and multidisciplinary environment, to contribute to setting up a local and robust dataset subdivided into two main subsets: the first consisting of images and the second of structured data. The dataset should be open, interoperable and aligned with the Metadata Schema 4.4 https://schema.datacite.org/.

Applicants can contribute to this project through the [project repository](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022) on GitHub. 

## Selecting a Task

Lists of newcomer-friendly and advanced tasks can be found in the [Starter Tasks](https://github.com/Mboalab/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022/tree/main/Starter%20Tasks) folder in the project repository. 
Applicants are encouraged to select a task based on personal interest, background and skills.

_**Both individual or collective contributions to a particular task are welcomed.**_

## Sending Contributions

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account and clone it into your development environment
2. Make sure to move to an **Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022** branch before making changes in your working directory
3. All contributions have to be listed in **Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022** folder.

    3.1 Create a folder with a naming convention **[Applicant Name]** (e.g **John Smith**) in **May-August-Contributions**

    3.2 List all your contributions in your **[Applicant Name]** folder in respective files *Task0.md*, *Task1.md*, and etc.

    The end result should resemble this:

           - May-August-Contributions
             - [Applicant Name]
                 - Task0.md
                 - Task1.md
                 - ...
