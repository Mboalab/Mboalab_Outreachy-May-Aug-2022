# Data Collection Tool
I decided to use online questionnaires to collect clinical data for this particular task. The platform I choose is [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/). 

The reason for choosing Jotform is its integration with third-party software like Google Sheets. All submissions will be automatically updated on the spreadsheets in real time. The spreadsheet (and possibly interactive graphs) can be established for local health care professionals and practitioners affiliated to access.


# Questionnaire Demo
The English questionnaire demo can be found [here](https://form.jotform.com/221046032751343). 

Considering that people filling out the form may speak different languages, it is possible to create other language versions of the form and include the links on every form. 

Other resources, such as government diagnostics or treatment advice, may also be included on the form. 


# Potential Alternatives
The limitation of the choice is that Jotform is a freemium program. The free plan offers 500 submissions for storage. 

So I am looking for an alternative and have found an open-source self-host solution: [Nextcloud Forms](https://github.com/nextcloud/forms). It may be a good alternative to creating the questionnaire.
