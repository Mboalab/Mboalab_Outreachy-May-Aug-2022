# Task 2

```
The prevalence, power and portability of smartphones make them valuable tools for pathogen monitoring and citizen science.
```

“Mobile apps that combine advanced data science with robust behavioral science models and user experience can drive the adoption of recommended health promotion and chronic disease management behaviors in a highly personalized, cost-efficient, and scalable way that can change the trajectory of the chronic disease epidemic.”

Health management apps that can: 
* **Assist individuals in monitoring their own health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy, mental health, and more,**
* **Allow healthcare providers to share and report on a patient's personal health records remotely, and**
* **Help keep track of medications.**

# Reason to use App

- *Aware the people by teaching them.*
- *Boon for Medical Staff.*
- *HealthCare Apps helps the Patients Located in Remote Areas.*
- *Blessing in Disguise for the Patients.*
- *Reduced Risk of Diagnostic Errors.*
- *People can monitor their Health condition.*
- *Streamlining Clinical Operations.*
- *Reduction in Medical Bills.*

**`Priyansh-App Typoid Fever`** is an Android mobile application designed to make smartphones an affordable yet effective solution to this issue. The idea is to get users familise with typoid fever on the basis of symptoms, teaching them the symptom, cause, types, diagnostic method for typoid fever, prevention methods etc.

Basically, app contains various features containing the information of various aspects like what is typoid fever, Causes, Symptom etc. At the end app is going to teach users about typoid fever, measures the possibility of typoid fever and i have also marked some future feature enhancements down in [this](https://github.com/ps-19/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022/tree/task/Priyansh_Singh/Task2#future-provision) section. 

App is very naive in solving the issue, but we can add functionality to make even better.

# Section

- Introduction to Typhoid Fever
- Clinical representation
- Causes
- Symptom
- Types
- Diagnosis
- Etiology
- Treatment
- Prevention
- Brief Description of  observational Epidemiology
- Highlights over differential-diagnostic physiopathology

# Future Provision

- [ ] Add a survey form.
- [ ] Add a primary test to check the percentage possibility of disease like in `Aarogya Setu`.
- [ ] Add a live data visualisation of number of cases in the world.
- [ ] Add nearby hospital info of government verified and suitable facility.

# Idea

- [Aarogya Setu](https://www.aarogyasetu.gov.in)
- [Malaria Screener](https://github.com/nlm-malaria/MalariaScreener)
