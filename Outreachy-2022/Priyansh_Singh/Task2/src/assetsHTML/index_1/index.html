<h1><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Typhoid Fever&nbsp;Clinical Presentation</span></h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<div class="refsection_content">
<p>A severe nonspecific febrile illness in a patient who has been exposed to typhoidal salmonella should always raise the diagnostic possibility of typhoid fever (enteric fever).</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e03e2d;">Classic typhoid fever syndrome</span></h3>
<p>The clinical syndromes associated with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>paratyphi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>are indistinguishable. Typhoid fever begins 7-14 days after ingestion of the organism<span>&nbsp;</span><em>.</em><span>&nbsp;</span>The fever pattern is stepwise, characterized by a rising temperature over the course of each day that drops by the subsequent morning. The peaks and troughs rise progressively over time.</p>
<p>Over the course of the first week of illness, the notorious gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease develop. These include diffuse abdominal pain and tenderness and, in some cases, fierce colicky right upper quadrant pain. Monocytic infiltration inflames Peyer patches and narrows the bowel lumen, causing constipation that lasts the duration of the illness. The individual then develops a dry cough, dull frontal headache, delirium, and an increasingly stuporous malaise.</p>
<p>At approximately the end of the first week of illness, the fever plateaus at 103-104&deg;F (39-40&deg;C). The patient develops rose spots, which are salmon-colored, blanching, truncal, maculopapules usually 1-4 cm wide and fewer than 5 in number; these generally resolve within 2-5 days.These are bacterial emboli to the dermis and occasionally develop in persons with<span>&nbsp;</span>shigellosis<span>&nbsp;</span>or nontyphoidal<span>&nbsp;</span>salmonellosis.</p>
<p>During the second week of illness, the signs and symptoms listed above progress. The abdomen becomes distended, and soft splenomegaly is common. Relative bradycardia and dicrotic pulse (double beat, the second beat weaker than the first) may develop.</p>
<p>In the third week, the still febrile individual grows more toxic and anorexic with significant weight loss. The conjunctivae are infected, and the patient is tachypneic with a thready pulse and crackles over the lung bases. Abdominal distension is severe. Some patients experience foul, green-yellow, liquid diarrhea (pea soup diarrhea). The individual may descend into the typhoid state, which is characterized by apathy, confusion, and even psychosis. Necrotic Peyer patches may cause bowel perforation and peritonitis. This complication is often unheralded and may be masked by corticosteroids. At this point, overwhelming toxemia,<span>&nbsp;</span>myocarditis, or intestinal hemorrhage may cause death.</p>
<p>If the individual survives to the fourth week, the fever, mental state, and abdominal distension slowly improve over a few days. Intestinal and neurologic complications may still occur in surviving untreated individuals. Weight loss and debilitating weakness last months. Some survivors become asymptomatic<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>carriers and have the potential to transmit the bacteria indefinitely.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Various presentations of typhoid fever</span></h3>
<p>The clinical course of a given individual with typhoid fever may deviate from the above description of classic disease. The timing of the symptoms and host response may vary based on geographic region, race factors, and the infecting bacterial strain. The stepladder fever pattern that was once the hallmark of typhoid fever now occurs in as few as 12% of cases. In most contemporary presentations of typhoid fever, the fever has a steady insidious onset.</p>
<p>Young children, individuals with AIDS, and one third of immunocompetent adults who develop typhoid fever develop diarrhea rather than constipation. In addition, in some localities, typhoid fever is generally more apt to cause diarrhea than constipation.</p>
<p>Atypical manifestations of typhoid fever include isolated severe headaches that may mimic<span>&nbsp;</span>meningitis, acute lobar pneumonia, isolated arthralgias, urinary symptoms, severe jaundice, or fever alone. Some patients, especially in India and Africa, present primarily with neurologic manifestations such as<span>&nbsp;</span>delirium<span>&nbsp;</span>or, in extremely rare cases, parkinsonian symptoms or Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. Other unusual complications include pancreatitis,meningitis,<span>&nbsp;</span>orchitis, osteomyelitis, and abscesses anywhere on the body.</p>
