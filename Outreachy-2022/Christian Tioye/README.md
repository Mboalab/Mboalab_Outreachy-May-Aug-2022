### Introducing Myself
Hi everyone! My name is Christian Tioye, I am a MS student in computer science looking to improve my programming skills and contribute to great projects. 
This project will be my first contribution to open source and I am glad to be here as part of the Outreachy initiative. I send a million thanks to the [mentors](https://github.com/PetraAG/Mboalab_Outreachy-May-Aug-2022/tree/main/Meet%20the%20Mentors) in advance for all the handholding I will likely need on this journey! 
This project is awesome because we need to use every tool available to defeat malaria and the project's success is great for Africa.. Let's do this!
