Task 1: DESIGN A DATA COLLECTION TOOL TO RECORD SYMPTOMS DATA

 Attributed Mentor: Stephane Fadanka

My contribution is to create a google form that's easy to use can be translated to other languages with real time
response to patients feedback. It's easy to monitor can be configured and the information can be shared to whoever 
needs it via mail. 

I created a google form with the link https://forms.gle/raccDQy4eVpE4kKU9 and can be imported into web pages through 
the link <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-YTML1SQpqRhryczdlp3QEV4YiPse2sTFIDZyt74g_eSdJw/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="4114" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loadingâ€¦</iframe>.

In conclusion, I went for google form as my data collection tool because it's easy to use, responses are sent to email 
addresses of Mboalab as I've linked it to the mentors email accounts; and it's widely acceptable and can be printed out in hardcopy for people without access to mobile devices and internet connection.
