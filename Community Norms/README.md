# CODE OF ETHICS AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

This code of conduct will guide interactions amongst applicants and between applicants and mentors during this contribution phase of the program. It will ensure that the core values of the Mboalab community which are rooted in mutual respect, kindness, openness, and collaboration are upheld.

# HOW WE WORK
We strive to make our community welcoming and open to everybody, regardless of scholarly or professional background, gender identity and expression, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, economic background, country of origin or employment, religion, and other characteristics.
All contributing applicants are trusted to put an effort into the task that they take on. We encourage frequent communication especially in tasks that require the effort of a team: team members are encouraged to share their progress and thoughts with everyone in a friendly and convivial manner.
- We accept failure but not lack of effort,
- Applicants are encouraged to keep their designated mentor and team members (where applicable) updated; 
- We follow the code of conduct and show deep respect to everyone who works with us;
- We are considerate of the different cultural origins and preferences of team members.
- We listen.

## A.	Personal behaviour, integrity and values
In line with Mboalab’s core values, applicants shall act with honesty, tolerance and respect. As we come from different backgrounds, it is important to be intentional about providing respectful, equitable space for our community to come together and engage in constructive, respectful discourse.
## B.	Effective communication
We begin interactions by acknowledging that we are part of a community with complementary goals. When something has happened and someone is uncomfortable, our first choice is to work through it with discussion. We listen to each other.
- For active listening, we ask questions first, instead of making statements.
- We give people time and space to respond.
- We appropriately adjust our behavior when asked to.
- We know that repeating hurtful behavior after it has been addressed is disrespectful.
- We avoid this ourselves and help others identify when they are doing it.
## C.	We practice consent
Permission should be requested before privately contacting a fellow applicant or sending explicit messages. This is also applicable to sharing private discussions. 
- Ask first.
- We respect everyone’s right to walk away at any time.
- If you see or experience a violation of consent, please contact the mentor in charge of your task or any of the other three mentors or get in touch with a community coordinator via email at thomasmboa@gmail.com.
>**NOTE:** Many forms of harassment do not look like physical or verbal abuse, but still fall into this category. Non-consent can include exhibiting sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or recording without permission, sustained disruption of talks or conversations, and unwelcome sexual attention.
## D.	Work spaces
All applicants should be involved in promoting open knowledge. All opinions matter! Open discussion allows the most promising ideas to come to the fore, and for decisions to be reached on a consensus basis. Communication platforms like Whatsapp group chats are for work-related conversation only. As such contents such as adverts or videos for entertainment are prohibited.
