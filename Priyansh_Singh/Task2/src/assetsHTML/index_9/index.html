<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Pathophysiology</span></h2>
<div class="refsection_content">
<p>All pathogenic<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Salmonella</em><span>&nbsp;</span>species, when present in the gut are engulfed by phagocytic cells, which then pass them through the mucosa and present them to the macrophages in the lamina propria. Nontyphoidal salmonellae are phagocytized throughout the distal ileum and colon. With toll-like receptor (TLR)&ndash;5 and TLR-4/MD2/CD-14 complex, macrophages recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as flagella and lipopolysaccharides. Macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells then attract T cells and neutrophils with interleukin 8 (IL-8), causing inflammation and suppressing the infection.</p>
<p>In contrast to the nontyphoidal salmonellae,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and paratyphi enter the host's system primarily through the distal ileum.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>They</em><span>&nbsp;</span>have specialized fimbriae that adhere to the epithelium over clusters of lymphoid tissue in the ileum (Peyer patches), the main relay point for macrophages traveling from the gut into the lymphatic system. The bacteria then induce their host macrophages to attract more macrophages.</p>
<p><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>has a Vi capsular antigen that masks PAMPs, avoiding neutrophil-based inflammation, while the most common<span>&nbsp;</span><em>paratyphi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>serovar,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>paratyphi A</em>, does not. This may explain the greater infectivity of typhi compared with most of its cousins.</p>
<p>Typhoidal salmonella co-opt the macrophages' cellular machinery for their own reproduction<sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup>as they are carried through the mesenteric lymph nodes to the thoracic duct and the lymphatics and then through to the reticuloendothelial tissues of the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Once there, they pause and continue to multiply until some critical density is reached. Afterward, the bacteria induce macrophage apoptosis, breaking out into the bloodstream to invade the rest of the body.</p>
<p>The bacteria then infect the gallbladder via either bacteremia or direct extension of infected bile. The result is that the organism re-enters the gastrointestinal tract in the bile and reinfects Peyer patches. Bacteria that do not reinfect the host are typically shed in the stool and are then available to infect other hosts.</p>
<p>Chronic carriers are responsible for much of the transmission of the organism. While asymptomatic, they may continue to shed bacteria in their stool for decades. The organisms sequester themselves either as a biofilm on gallstones or gallbladder epithelium or, perhaps, intracellularly, within the epithelium itself.The bacteria excreted by a single carrier may have multiple genotypes, making it difficult to trace an outbreak to its origin.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Risk factors</span></h3>
<p>Typhoidal salmonella have no nonhuman vectors. An inoculum as small as 100,000 organisms of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>causes infection in more than 50% of healthy volunteers.<sup><span> </span></sup><em>Paratyphi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>requires a much higher inoculum to infect, and it is less endemic in rural areas. Hence, the patterns of transmission are slightly different.</p>
<p>The following are modes of transmission of typhoidal salmonella:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="topbullet">
<p>Oral transmission via food or beverages handled by an often asymptomatic individual a carrier who chronically sheds the bacteria through stool or, less commonly, urine</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="topbullet">
<p>Hand-to-mouth transmission after using a contaminated toilet and neglecting hand hygiene</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="topbullet">
<p>Oral transmission via sewage-contaminated water or shellfish (especially in the developing world).</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Paratyphi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is more commonly transmitted in food from street vendors. It is believed that some such foods provide a friendly environment for the microbe.</p>
<p><em>Paratyphi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>is more common among newcomers to urban areas, probably because they tend to be immunologically na&iuml;ve to it. Also, travellers get little or no protection against<span>&nbsp;</span><em>paratyphi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>from the current typhoid vaccines, all of which target<span>&nbsp;</span><em>typhi</em>.</p>
<p>Typhoidal salmonella are able to survive a stomach pH as low as 1.5. Antacids, histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2 blockers), proton pump inhibitors, gastrectomy, and achlorhydria decrease stomach acidity and facilitate<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>infection.</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS<span>&nbsp;</span>is clearly associated with an increased risk of nontyphoidal<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Salmonella</em><span>&nbsp;</span>infection; however, the data and opinions in the literature as to whether this is true for<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>or paratyphi infection are conflicting. If an association exists, it is probably minor.<sup><span>&nbsp;</span>[<a onclick="showToolTip(this,'references-layer','15')">15</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a onclick="showToolTip(this,'references-layer','16')">16</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a onclick="showToolTip(this,'references-layer','17')">17</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a onclick="showToolTip(this,'references-layer','18')">18</a>]</sup></p>
<p>Other risk factors for typhoid fever include various genetic polymorphisms. These risk factors often also predispose to other intracellular pathogens. For instance,<span>&nbsp;</span><em>PARK2</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>PACGR</em><span>&nbsp;</span>code for a protein aggregate that is essential for breaking down the bacterial signaling molecules that dampen the macrophage response. Polymorphisms in their shared regulatory region are found disproportionately in persons infected with<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Mycobacterium leprae</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, protective host mutations also exist. The fimbriae of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>bind in vitro to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance receptor (CFTR), which is expressed on the gut membrane. Two to 5% of white persons are heterozygous for the CFTR mutation F508del, which is associated with a decreased susceptibility to typhoid fever, as well as to<span>&nbsp;</span>cholera<span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span>tuberculosis. The homozygous F508del mutation in CFTR is associated with cystic fibrosis. Thus, typhoid fever may contribute to evolutionary pressure that maintains a steady occurrence of cystic fibrosis, just as<span>&nbsp;</span>malaria<span>&nbsp;</span>maintains<span>&nbsp;</span>sickle cell disease<span>&nbsp;</span>in Africa.</p>
<p>As the middle class in south Asia grows, some hospitals there are seeing a large number of typhoid fever cases among relatively well-off university students who live in group households with poor hygiene. American clinicians should keep this in mind, as students from these areas often come to the United States for further education.</p>
