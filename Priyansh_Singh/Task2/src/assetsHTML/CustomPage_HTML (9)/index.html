<p class="css-dmtxcr">Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. It can be fatal. It is caused by the bacteria<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Salmonella typhi.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The infection is often passed on through contaminated food and drinking water, and it is more prevalent in places where handwashing is less frequent. It can also be passed on by carriers who do not know they carry the bacteria.</p>
<p>Annually, there are around<span>&nbsp;</span>5,700 cases<span>&nbsp;</span>in the United States, and 75 percent of these start while traveling internationally. Globally, around 21.5 million people a year contract typhoid.</p>
<p>If typhoid is caught early, it can be successfully treated with antibiotics; if it is not treated, typhoid can be<span>&nbsp;</span>fatal.</p>

</div>
<p>Typhoid is an infection caused by the bacterium<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhi)</em>.</p>
<p>The bacterium lives in the intestines and bloodstream of humans. It spreads between individuals by direct contact with the feces of an infected person.</p>
<p>No animals carry this disease, so transmission is always human to human.</p>
<p>If untreated, around<span>&nbsp;</span>1 in 5 cases<span>&nbsp;</span>of typhoid can be fatal. With treatment, fewer than 4 in 100 cases are fatal.</p>
<p><em>S. typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>enters through the mouth and spends 1 to 3 weeks in the intestine. After this, it makes its way through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>From the bloodstream, it spreads into other tissues and organs. The immune system of the host can do little to fight back because<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S. typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>can live within the host&rsquo;s cells, safe from the<span>&nbsp;</span>immune system.</p>
<p>Typhoid is diagnosed by detecting the presence of<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S. typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>via blood, stool, urine, or<span>&nbsp;</span>bone marrow<span>&nbsp;</span>sample.</p>
<div><a name="treatment"></a>Treatment</div>
<p>The only effective treatment for typhoid is antibiotics. The most commonly used are ciprofloxacin (for non-pregnant adults) and ceftriaxone.</p>
<p>Other than antibiotics, it is important to rehydrate by drinking adequate water.</p>
<p>In more severe cases, where the bowel has become perforated, surgery may be required.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Typhoid antibiotic resistance</span></h3>
<p>As with a number of other bacterial diseases, there is<span>&nbsp;</span>currently concern<span>&nbsp;</span>about the growing resistance of antibiotics to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S. typhi.</em></p>
<p>This is impacting the choice of drugs available to treat typhoid. In recent years, for example, typhoid has become resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin.</p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin, one of the key medications for typhoid, is also experiencing similar difficulties. Some studies have found<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Salmonella typhimurium</em><span>&nbsp;</span>resistance rates to be around<span>&nbsp;</span>35 percent</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Surgical Care</span></h2>
<div class="refsection_content">
<p>Surgery is usually indicated in cases of intestinal perforation. Most surgeons prefer simple closure of the perforation with drainage of the peritoneum. Small-bowel resection is indicated for patients with multiple perforations.</p>
<p>If antibiotic treatment fails to eradicate the hepatobiliary carriage, the gallbladder should be resected. Cholecystectomy is not always successful in eradicating the carrier state because of hepatic infection.</p>
