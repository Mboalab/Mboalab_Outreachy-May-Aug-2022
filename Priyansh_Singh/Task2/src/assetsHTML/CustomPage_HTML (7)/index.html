<h1><span style="background-color: #ba372a;">What Is Salmonella<br /></span></h1>
<p><strong>Foodborne Salmonella infections cause diarrhea and other symptoms that typically resolve on their own.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Salmonella is a group of bacteria that commonly causes foodborne illness in the United States.</p>
<p>An infection by the bacteria is called salmonellosis (or simply salmonella), and you can get it by consuming contaminated food products including raw poultry, eggs, beef, and sometimes unwashed fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Handling pets particularly reptiles such as snakes, turtles, and lizards can also spread the bacteria.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #169179;">Types of Salmonella</span></h2>
<p>Salmonella is divided into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Typhoidal Salmonella, which is made up of bacterial strains that cause typhoid fever or paratyphoid fever, including Salmonella Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, and Paratyphi C</li>
<li>Non-typhoidal Salmonella, which includes all other Salmonella strains</li>
</ul>
<p>In the United States, Salmonella Typhi the typhoidal Salmonella strain that most commonly causes disease leads to 5,700 illnesses and 620 hospitalizations each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Most Salmonella Typhi infections seen in the United States originate outside the country.</p>
<p>This bacterial strain causes approximately 21.7 million illnesses each year worldwide, the CDC notes.</p>
<p>Non-typhoidal Salmonella causes about 1.2 million illnesses and 450 deaths each year in the United States. Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis are the most common strains.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Salmonella Symptoms</span></h2>
<p>Non-typhoidal Salmonella causes a mild to severe diarrheal illness called acute<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #e03e2d;">gastroenteritis</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Symptoms, which typically begin 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the bacteria, can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diarrhea, which may be bloody</li>
<li>Abdominal cramps</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
</ul>
<p>Typhoid fever causes a sustained fever of 103 to 104 degrees F (39 to 40 degrees C), and sometimes also causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weakness</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Stomach pains</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
<li>Skin rash</li>
</ul>
<p>Salmonella infections can cause complications if the bacteria become invasive and affect areas outside of the digestive system, including the bloodstream, bones, joints, central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), or other internal organs.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Salmonella Treatment</span></h2>
<p>Most Salmonella-related gastroenteritis cases resolve within 5 to 7 days without any treatment.</p>
<p>If severe dehydration from diarrhea occurs, administering intravenous fluids may be necessary.</p>
<p>Antibiotic<span>&nbsp;</span>treatment is reserved for severe cases of salmonella, and for infected people with a high risk of complications.</p>
<p>Antibiotic options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluoroquinolones, such as<span>&nbsp;</span>ciprofloxacin</li>
<li>Third-generation<span>&nbsp;</span>cephalosporins, such as<span>&nbsp;</span>ceftriaxone,<span>&nbsp;</span>cefepime, or<span>&nbsp;</span>ceftazidime</li>
<li>Ampicillin</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Salmonella 'Superbugs'</span></h2>
<p>In recent years, Salmonella "superbugs" strains of the bacteria that are resistant to the drugs typically used to treat infections have become a serious concern in the United States, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>About 3 percent of non-typhoidal Salmonella infections appear to be resistant to ceftriaxone, another 3 percent show some resistance to ciprofloxacin, and about 5 percent are resistant to five or more types of drugs, the CDC notes.</p>
<p>Salmonella Typhi is also showing resistance to ceftriaxone,<span>&nbsp;</span>azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. In fact, 67 percent of Salmonella Typhi infections are drug-resistant, according to the CDC</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gastroenteritis is often called the &ldquo;stomach flu,&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s not a type of flu at all. Instead, it&rsquo;s an inflammation of the lining of your intestines.</p>
<p>Most of the time, a virus is the culprit, and the illness is considered &ldquo;viral gastroenteritis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally, bacteria, parasites, or other causes may trigger gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>Avoiding contaminated food and water, along with frequent hand-washing, may help protect you from this unwelcome condition.</p>

<h2><span style="background-color: #169179;">How Does Gastroenteritis Spread?</span></h2>
<p>Gastroenteritis is a contagious illness and is commonly spread by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating contaminated food (especially seafood or raw foods)</li>
<li>Drinking contaminated water</li>
<li>Being in close contact with an infected person</li>
<li>Using dirty utensils</li>
</ul>
<p>Viruses are often passed through the fecal-oral route. This means someone with the virus touches the food you eat without washing their hands after using the bathroom.</p>

<h2><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">What Viruses Cause Gastroenteritis?</span></h2>
<p>In the United States, viruses are the most common reason for gastroenteritis. (1) Many viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Norovirus</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Norovirus<span>&nbsp;</span>affects both children and adults and is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the world. (2)&nbsp;Most of the time, this virus is passed on through contaminated water or food. It spreads quickly, especially among people in confined spaces. You may have heard about the norovirus affecting passengers on cruise ships. Outbreaks are also common in nursing homes and other places where people are in close contact with one another. Symptoms usually last one to three days. (1,3)</li>
<li><strong>Rotavirus</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children. (2) It frequently affects babies between ages 3 and 15 months. Symptoms last from three to seven days. The virus is usually less severe when it impacts adults. There&rsquo;s a<span>&nbsp;</span>vaccine<span>&nbsp;</span>available in the United States to protect against rotavirus. Since this vaccine has been introduced, cases of rotavirus have been reduced by 80 percent. (1,3)</li>
<li><strong>Adenovirus</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This virus most often affects children under age 2. The symptoms may last 5 to 12 days.</li>
<li><strong>Astrovirus</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Infants and young children are more likely to get astrovirus, but it can infect anyone. It&rsquo;s typically spread by the fecal-oral route and lasts about three to four days.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Other Causes</span></h2>
<p>Gastroenteritis that isn&rsquo;t caused by a virus may be due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bacteria</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, C<em>lostridium difficile</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(<em>C. difficile</em>), and<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Escherichia coli (E. coli)<span>&nbsp;</span></em>infections sometimes lead to gastroenteritis. These bacteria can spread by consuming food or water that&rsquo;s been contaminated. (1)</li>
<li><strong>Parasites</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Most cases of parasitic gastroenteritis are caused by giardia and cryptosporidium.These organisms can be picked up by drinking contaminated water or swimming in a contaminated pool.</li>
<li><strong>Other Causes<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Ingesting certain drugs or chemical toxins, such as metals or plant substances, may rarely lead to gastroenteritis.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>

<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Symptoms</span></h2>
<p>Symptoms usually start about one to two days after the virus enters your body and may include (3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Watery<span>&nbsp;</span>diarrhea</li>
<li>Stomach pain or cramps</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Muscle aches</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Chills</li>
<li>Excessive sweating</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically, these symptoms last a day or two, but they can persist for up to 10 days. (2,3)</p>

<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Who Gets Gastroenteritis?</span></h2>
<p>Gastroenteritis can affect anyone, but certain people may be at an increased risk, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Children and Babies<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Kids&rsquo; immune systems haven&rsquo;t fully developed, which puts them at risk for catching viruses.</li>
<li><strong>Older Adults</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>As you age, your immune system becomes less efficient.</li>
<li><strong>People Who Live in or Visit Group Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Being in close quarters with others can increase your risk of gastroenteritis. Locations like schools, day cares, nursing homes, cruise ships, and dorms may harbor viruses and bacteria.</li>
<li><strong>People With Weakened Immune Systems</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Some chronic illnesses, such as HIV, can compromise your immune system and make you more susceptible to developing gastroenteritis. (2)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>Doctors typically diagnose gastroenteritis by inquiring about your symptoms and performing a physical exam.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider might ask you questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did your symptoms start?</li>
<li>Have your symptoms been constant, or do they start and stop?</li>
<li>How severe are your symptoms?</li>
<li>Does anything you do seem to improve or worsen your symptoms?</li>
<li>Do you have any signs of<span>&nbsp;</span>dehydration?</li>
<li>Have you been in contact with other people who have the same symptoms as you?</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor might also order a rapid stool test to see if you have norovirus or rotavirus. Additionally, you might be asked to provide a stool sample to detect a bacterial or parasitic infection.</p>
<p>Sometimes, gastroenteritis is mistaken for illnesses, such as appendicitis, a urinary tract infection (UTI), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or others.</p>

<h2><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Treatment</span></h2>
<p>Gastroenteritis will usually run its course and go away on its own.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no specific medical treatment for viral gastroenteritis.</p>
<p>If you have a bacterial infection, your doctor might prescribe<span>&nbsp;</span>antibiotics.</p>
<p>Some healthcare providers recommend probiotics, which are live microbes, to help your symptoms. If you have gastroenteritis, talk to your doctor before using a probiotic.</p>
<p>Physicians usually don&rsquo;t suggest that you take anti-diarrheal treatments because they can prolong the infection, especially in children. But these medicines may be beneficial in some cases.</p>

<h2><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Home Remedies</span></h2>
<p>Certain home remedies can help improve symptoms and prevent dehydration. You might want to try:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letting Your Stomach Settle<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Taking a break from eating solid foods for a few hours at a time may alleviate your stomach troubles.</li>
<li><strong>Avoiding Certain Foods and Substances</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Stay away from caffeine; alcohol; dairy products; and fatty, sugary, or spicy foods until you start to feel better.</li>
<li><strong>Eating Bland Foods</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Plain foods are less likely to irritate your digestive system. Crackers, toast, bananas, gelatin, rice, potatoes, and chicken are some good choices.</li>
<li><strong>Staying Hydrated</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Try to drink plenty of liquids. You might want to suck on ice chips or take small sips of water. Clear sodas, broths, and noncaffeinated sports drinks can keep you hydrated. Children might need an oral rehydration solution, which is available at most pharmacies. If you&rsquo;re breastfeeding or formula-feeding a baby, continue to feed the child as usual.</li>
<li><strong>Getting Lots of Rest</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Gastroenteritis can zap your energy. Be sure to rest when you can and get a good night&rsquo;s sleep.</li>
<li>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>If you have gastroenteritis, dehydration is the main complication to worry about. This happens when you lose an extreme amount of water, salts, and minerals.</p>
<p>Signs of dehydration may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme thirst</li>
<li>Urinating less often</li>
<li>Dark-colored urine</li>
<li>Dizziness</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
<li>Tiredness</li>
<li>Lack of energy</li>
<li>Sunken eyes or cheeks</li>
</ul>
<p>If babies become dehydrated, they might:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cry without tears</li>
<li>Have a dry mouth and tongue</li>
<li>Have no wet diapers for three hours or longer</li>
<li>Be very sleepy or drowsy</li>
<li>Have a fever</li>
<li>Have a sunken fontanel (the soft spot on the top of a baby&rsquo;s head)</li>
</ul>
<p>Severe dehydration can lead to organ damage, shock, a coma, or even death.</p>
<p>Sometimes serious cases of dehydration may require a hospital stay, so you can receive fluids intravenously (through an IV). Infants, older adults, and people with compromised immune systems are at a greater risk of developing severe dehydration.</p>
<p>Symptoms, which typically begin 12 to 72 hours after exposure to the bacteria, can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diarrhea, which may be bloody</li>
<li>Abdominal cramps</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Loss of appetite</li>
