<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p><strong>United States</strong></p>
<p>Since 1900, improved sanitation and successful antibiotic treatment have steadily decreased the incidence of typhoid fever in the United States. In 1920, 35,994 cases of typhoid fever were reported. In 2006, there were 314.</p>
<p>Between 1999 and 2006, 79% of typhoid fever cases occurred in patients who had been outside of the country within the preceding 30 days. Two thirds of these individuals had just journeyed from the Indian subcontinent. The 3 known outbreaks of typhoid fever within the United States were traced to imported food or to a food handler from an endemic region. Remarkably, only 17% of cases acquired domestically were traced to a carrier.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #e67e23;"><strong>International</strong></span></p>
<p>Typhoid fever occurs worldwide, primarily in developing nations whose sanitary conditions are poor. Typhoid fever is endemic in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Oceania, but 80% of cases come from Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, or Vietnam.<sup><span> </span></sup>Within those countries, typhoid fever is most common in underdeveloped areas. Typhoid fever infects roughly 21.6 million people (incidence of 3.6 per 1,000 population) and kills an estimated 200,000 people every year.</p>
<p>In the United States, most cases of typhoid fever arise in international travelers. The average yearly incidence of typhoid fever per million travelers from 1999-2006 by county or region of departure was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="topbullet">
<p>Western Hemisphere outside US - 1.3</p>

<h3><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Mortality/Morbidity</span></h3>
<p>With prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy, typhoid fever is typically a short-term febrile illness requiring a median of 6 days of hospitalization. Treated, it has few long-term sequelae and a 0.2% risk of mortality.<sup><span> </span></sup>Untreated typhoid fever is a life-threatening illness of several weeks' duration with long-term morbidity often involving the central nervous system. The case fatality rate in the United States in the pre-antibiotic era was 9%-13%.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Race</span></h3>
<p>Typhoid fever has no racial predilection.</p>
<h3>Sex</h3>
<p>Fifty-four percent of typhoid fever cases in the United States reported between 1999 and 2006 involved males.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Age</span></h3>
<p>Most documented typhoid fever cases involve school-aged children and young adults. However, the true incidence among very young children and infants is thought to be higher. The presentations in these age groups may be atypical, ranging from a mild febrile illness to severe convulsions, and the<span>&nbsp;</span><em>S typhi</em><span>&nbsp;</span>infection may go unrecognized. This may account for conflicting reports in the literature that this group has either a very high or a very low rate of morbidity and mortality.<sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup></p>
