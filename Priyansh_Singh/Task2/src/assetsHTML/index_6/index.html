<h2><span style="background-color: #e03e2d;">Prevention A</span></h2>
<p>In many developing nations, the public health goals that can help prevent and control typhoid fever safe drinking water, improved sanitation and adequate medical care may be difficult to achieve. For that reason, some experts believe that vaccinating high-risk populations is the best way to control typhoid fever.</p>
<p>A vaccine is recommended if you live in or you're traveling to areas where the risk of getting typhoid fever is high.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e03e2d;">Vaccines</span></h3>
<p>Two vaccines are available.</p>
<ul>
<li>One is injected in a single dose at least one week before travel.</li>
<li>One is given orally in four capsules, with one capsule to be taken every other day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither vaccine is 100 percent effective, and both require repeat immunizations, as vaccine effectiveness diminishes over time.</p>
<p>Because the vaccine won't provide complete protection, follow these guidelines when traveling to high-risk areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wash your hands.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Frequent hand-washing in hot, soapy water is the best way to control infection. Wash before eating or preparing food and after using the toilet. Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for times when water isn't available.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid drinking untreated water.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Contaminated drinking water is a particular problem in areas where typhoid fever is endemic. For that reason, drink only bottled water or canned or bottled carbonated beverages, wine and beer. Carbonated bottled water is safer than uncarbonated bottled water is.</p>
<p>Ask for drinks without ice. Use bottled water to brush your teeth, and try not to swallow water in the shower.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Avoid raw fruits and vegetables.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Because raw produce may have been washed in unsafe water, avoid fruits and vegetables that you can't peel, especially lettuce. To be absolutely safe, you may want to avoid raw foods entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Choose hot foods.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Avoid food that's stored or served at room temperature. Steaming hot foods are best. And although there's no guarantee that meals served at the finest restaurants are safe, it's best to avoid food from street vendors it's more likely to be contaminated.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e03e2d;">Prevent infecting others</span></h3>
<p>If you're recovering from typhoid fever, these measures can help keep others safe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take your antibiotics.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Follow your doctor's instructions for taking your antibiotics, and be sure to finish the entire prescription.</li>
<li><strong>Wash your hands often.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This is the single most important thing you can do to keep from spreading the infection to others. Use hot, soapy water and scrub thoroughly for at least 30 seconds, especially before eating and after using the toilet.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid handling food.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Avoid preparing food for others until your doctor says you're no longer contagious. If you work in the food service industry or a health care facility, you won't be allowed to return to work until tests show that you're no longer shedding typhoid bacteria.</li>

<p>Countries with less access to clean water and washing facilities typically have a higher number of typhoid cases.</p>

<p>Before traveling to a high-risk area, getting vaccinated against typhoid fever is recommended.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by oral medication or a one-off injection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oral: a live, attenuated vaccine. Consists of 4 tablets, one to be taken every second day, the last of which is taken 1 week before travel.</li>
<li>Shot, an inactivated vaccine, administered 2 weeks before travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccines are not 100 percent effective and caution should still be exercised when eating and drinking.</p>
<p>Vaccination should not be started if the individual is currently ill or if they are under 6 years of age. Anyone with<span>&nbsp;</span>HIV<span>&nbsp;</span>should not take the live, oral dose.</p>
<p>The vaccine may have adverse effects.<span>&nbsp;</span>One in 100<span>&nbsp;</span>people will experience a fever. After the oral vaccine, there may be gastrointestinal problems, nausea, and headache. However, severe side effects are rare with either vaccine.</p>
<p>There are two types of typhoid vaccine available, but a more powerful vaccine is still needed. The live, oral version of the vaccine is the strongest of the two. After 3 years, it still protects individuals from infection<span>&nbsp;</span>73 percent<span>&nbsp;</span>of the time. However, this vaccine has more side effects.</p>
<p>The current vaccines are not always effective, and because typhoid is so prevalent in poorer countries, more research needs to be done to find better ways of preventing its spread.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Eliminating typhoid</span></h3>
<p>Even when the symptoms of typhoid have passed, it is still possible to be carrying the bacteria.</p>
<p>This makes it hard to stamp out the disease, because carriers whose symptoms have finished may be less careful when washing food or interacting with others.</p>
<p>People traveling in Africa, South America, and Asia, and India in particular, should be vigilant.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #e67e23;">Avoiding infection</span></h3>
<p>Typhoid is spread by contact and ingestion of infected human feces. This can happen through an infected water source or when handling food.</p>
<p>The following are some general rules to follow when traveling to help minimize the chance of typhoid infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drink bottled water, preferably carbonated.</li>
<li>If bottled water cannot be sourced, ensure water is heated on a rolling boil for at least one minute before consuming.</li>
<li>Be wary of eating anything that has been handled by someone else.</li>
<li>Avoid eating at street food stands, and only eat food that is still hot.</li>
<li>Do not have ice in drinks.</li>
<li>Avoid raw fruit and vegetables, peel fruit yourself, and do not eat the peel.</li>
</ul>
